        Use Case Problem: 
        We can create many operations in inventory, and some operations are very related to the accounting especially when it is related to the cost valuation.
        For example, when we scrap the products, the value of the product will be deducted, and when we used that product for specific purpose it wil be deducted. 
        and we need to know in the accounting report those cost are allocated in which operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution: To let the account understand the input from inventory, it could communicate by the analytic account. As you may know, analytic account is used to 
        seperate the cost so we can know the value to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feature: Therefre, this module is created in order to let the inventory user could apply the analytic account after the operation done so the accounting will know real time.
